# Face generation

In this project I developed a Generative adversarial network (GAN) to create photo-realistic images of people. 

The GAN was trained initially on the [MINST handwritten database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), to quickly check it's design, performance and accuracy. 

The GAN consisted of two main parts:

+ The adversariay 
After designing and tuning the converlutional neural network (CNN) used to analyse the images

Python


## What is a GAN?
According to [Yann LeCun](https://medium.com/@devnag/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-in-50-lines-of-code-pytorch-e81b79659e3f)(director of Facebook AI) "General Adversarial Networks is the most **interesting idea in the past ten years** in machine learning."

In 2014 Ian Goodfellow returned home from a going away drinks at the bar, where he and his friends were discussing issues around the inefficient method by which a machine learning algorithm learns about unlabelled data. An example of this is who a child learns to recognise a letter in the alphabet that their teacher shows them, they only need to see it a few times, where as amachine learning algorithms need to be shown thousands of variations of the same letter before they can perform the same image recognition task.

That night Ian went home and coded up a simple prototype of the GAN to learn to recognise the numbers in the MINST data set. It worked and led to the [following paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) being released to [NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems)](https://nips.cc/About)

## Generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate new images of faces
There are many types of GANs, most are good at working with images.

### Stack GAN model
Good at taking textual description of a bird, e.g. "This bird has a white breast, light grey head, black wings and tail" and then generating a high resolution photo of a bird that matches the description. The images have never been seen before and are totally imaginary.




# Neural Network built from scratch with Python and numpy

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcarlyle/udacity_deep_learning_foundations__p1/master/cyclenetlogo.png "Cycle net") There are a lot of libraries available (like Tensorflow) to help build Neural Networks, however it is important to understand the basic building blocks. This is especially important for machine learning which requires various aspects of statisitics, mathematics, computing, information science and some understanding of the hardware available (STEM):

+ Data manipulation - an understand of how to shape the data
+ Hyper parameters - how to tune the network to achieve convergence in a suitable time with the avialable computing power
+ Gradient descent - to converge towards the optimal solution
+ Back propogation - to train the network and update it's weights

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset "Data set").
